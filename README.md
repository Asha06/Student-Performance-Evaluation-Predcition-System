# Student-Performance-Evaluation-Predcition-System
   The main aim is to create a system which analyzes data, helps to Evaluates the student Performance and also guids the future scope of
   the students on basis of the existing historical data.
Within the java code, we have created various classes such as Student, Grade & Main class. 
 The Student Class takes the input values as marks for each semester & assigns them to the created local variables for each subject. 
Similarly the marks of every semester is been taken from 1st to 8th SEM.
 The Grade Class evaluates the Sum of all marks & calculates the Average score of each semester. On this basis the Grades are being 
assigned. This class also helps in suggesting the student in which field he/she is good at? So that this suggestion helps the candidate to
know which field is more suitable. 
 The Main Class invokes the functionalities of the Student & Grade class, using their class objects the methods are invoked & processed
for the required functionality.
